# Enigma
----------

This project aims to structure the Engima Machine behavior in an OO application using TDD, Java 11, Gradle, Spock
This projects simulates how an Enigma machine works under the hood.

### A little background

Enigma, was a cipher machine built by the Nazi Germany to 
encrypt/decrypt secret messages containing war instructions. Messages were sent by radio across all Europe to German
troops but the communication could be intercepted by enemies. However, even in position of the message, the enemies
couldn't interpret it. Only with another engima machine (with the right configuration) could interpret the message as it
was. 

Enigma Machine has definitely its place in human/computer history. The great german machine was widely used during WW2
using a rotors' system with patterns being changed every day. Understand how it works and how Alan Turing managed to break
its code is what moved this project.
